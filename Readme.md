# Chinmay Vibhute

Hello there! Thanks for visitingðŸ˜Š

I am Chinmay Vibhute, a Pre-Final Year Undergraduate Student of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, pursuing my Dual Degree(B.Tech + M.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering. (I am a developer though...)

I actively compete on [Topcoder](topcoder.com/members/chinvib66/) and started recently on Kaggle.
